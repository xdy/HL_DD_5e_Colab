  <thing id="r5CVGMFirb" name="Firbolg" description="Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and instead identify the forest’s children by their deeds, habits, and other actions. \n\nBy the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their  their own kin they simply call it &quot;home.&quot;\n\nSometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.\n\n{b}Firbolg Classes{/b}\nMost firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs&apos; magical heritage also expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards preserve the clan&apos;s lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves.\n\n* Firbolg rogues are typically scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements.\n* Firbolg barbarians are rare except among clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders. \n* Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods and are seen as enforcers of that god’s will. \n* Firbolg warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings. \n* Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of a devastated firbolg clan." compset="Race">

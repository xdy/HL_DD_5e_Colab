Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others. \nThe bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are  the stuff of legend. The bards of this college are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds.\nVillainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls." compset="CustomSpec" summary="You have been trained in the traditions of the Feywild" uniqueness="unique">

They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats. \nMany other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bards’ reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, these bards rarely reveal their true nature unless they must. They typically claim to follow some other college, or keep their true nature secret in order to better infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power." compset="CustomSpec" summary="You learned to excel at guile and deceit" uniqueness="unique">
